# ResoniteAnimatedImageExporter

AnimatedPhotoExporter is a [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/). It adds an "Animated photo" export path to screenshot context menus, saving animated textures as lossless files (default: WebP, optional MNG) alongside the regular still image flow. The mod uses the shipped `FrooxEngine` API surface (confirmed from assemblies: `PhotoMetadata.GenerateMenuItems(ContextMenu, List<IContextMenuItemSource>)`) and exposes format selection through the ResoniteModLoader configuration UI.

## Installation

1. Install the [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place the [AnimatedPhotoExporter.dll](https://github.com/esnya/ResoniteAnimatedImageExporter/releases/latest/download/AnimatedPhotoExporter.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a standard installation. You can create it if it's missing, or if you start the game once with the ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
1. Launch the game. If you want to check that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.

## Development

### Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK (install the latest preview until GA ships)
- A Resonite installation that exposes `FrooxEngine.dll` (the default Steam paths on Windows/WSL are discovered automatically, otherwise pass `-p:ResonitePath=/absolute/path/to/Resonite`)
- [ResoniteHotReloadLib](https://github.com/Nytra/ResoniteHotReloadLib) if you plan to use hot reload

### Installation for Development

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure the Resonite installation path is reachable. If it lives somewhere unusual, add `-p:ResonitePath="/path/to/Resonite"` to your build/test commands.
3. Build the project: `dotnet build`

### Development Workflow

- Before committing, run `dotnet format ResoniteAnimatedImageExporter.sln --verify-no-changes --no-restore`.
- Keep local builds/tests aligned with CI by running `dotnet build ResoniteAnimatedImageExporter.sln -c Release -p:ResonitePath="..."` and `dotnet test ResoniteAnimatedImageExporter.sln -c Release -p:ResonitePath="..."`.
- Refer to `AGENTS.md` for the authoritative checklist shared with CI.

### Animated export behavior

- Adds a context menu entry via a Harmony postfix on `PhotoMetadata.GenerateMenuItems(ContextMenu, List<IContextMenuItemSource>)`.
- Export is gated by mod configuration (`Enabled`, `AnimatedFormat`), with the format surface pluggable (default: WebP). Configuration is managed through the RML config UI.
- Animated metadata detection depends on a supported animated screenshot component present in the shipped Resonite assemblies; until that is present, the export entry stays suppressed to avoid incorrect output.

### Install to `rml_mods` Directory (and `rml_mods/HotReloadMods`)

Set `CopyToMods=true` when building to mirror the compiled DLL into your Resonite install automatically:

```bash
dotnet build -p:CopyToMods=true -p:ResonitePath="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite"
```

### Hot Reload Development

Opt-in to hot reload support by dropping [ResoniteHotReloadLib](https://github.com/Nytra/ResoniteHotReloadLib) into `$(ResonitePath)/rml_libs` and passing `-p:EnableResoniteHotReloadLib=true` (include it alongside `CopyToMods=true` if you also want the HotReloadMods copy). Without that property the project omits both the reference and compiler symbol, so developers without the DLL can still build.

### Versioning & Releases

[GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/) supplies semantic versions for builds and packages. Push a `v*` tag (for example `v0.2.0`) and the CI workflow will build, test, and publish the release artifacts automatically.
